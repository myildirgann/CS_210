# Personal Health Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Personal Health Data Analysis Project! This project delves into the exploration and analysis of over 220,000 lines of personal health data recorded by the Mi Band 4 from August 2020 to May 2023. The dataset includes detailed measurements such as daily step count (day-to-day and minute-to-minute), sleep duration, and deep and shallow sleep time. This report contains the results of detailed analysis on the dataset. The dataset, associated python notebook and detailed project report are available from the link: https://github.com/myildirgann/CS_210.git 

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to investigate correlations between various activity levels and sleep parameters. Additionally, the analysis aims to make inferences on specific aspects, such as the impact of lockdowns on total sleep time during the pandemic and variations in physical activity when schools are open. Because the dataset provides extensive data covering more than 900 days, it is easy to make robust and unbiased inferences about the results.

## Data Source

- **Mi Fit Health Tracker App & Mi Band 4**: The health data used for this analysis is sourced from the Mi Fit Health Tracker App, capturing information recorded by the Mi Band 4 wearable device.

## Data Analysis Techniques

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA technique is used to explore the structure of the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing techniques such as data imputation, are applied to ensure the quality and completeness of the dataset. 

3. **Correlation Analysis:** Correlation analysis is employed to examine the relationships between activity and sleep parameters. 

4. **Data Visualization:** Various visualization techniques, such as bar charts with gradient colors, are used to visually represent and interpret complex data parameters.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is rooted in a desire to understand personal sleep and activity patterns over an extensive period (over 900 days). The belief is that the substantial dataset allows for unbiased estimations and valuable insights into the user's health trends.

## Usage

1. **Data:** The raw data is stored in the "data" directory. It includes CSV files containing daily step counts, minute-to-minute activity logs, and detailed sleep metrics.

2. **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks in the "notebooks" directory contain the code for data analysis. Start with the "Data_Analysis.ipynb" notebook for an overview of the analysis process.

3. **Results:** Findings and visualizations are presented in the "results" directory.

## Requirements
